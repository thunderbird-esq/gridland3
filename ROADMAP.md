## âœ… Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Refactor (COMPLETE)

**Objective:** Transform the non-functional, facade-based codebase into a working, modular, and production-grade security scanning platform.

**Key Achievements:**
- âœ… **Architectural Overhaul:** Eliminated all placeholder code and fake frameworks.
- âœ… **Modular System:** Implemented a real `lib/` architecture with distinct, testable components for scanning, identification, and job management.
- âœ… **Plugin Architecture:** Built a working plugin system with 7 functional scanner plugins.
- âœ… **Web & CLI Interfaces:** Created both a live web interface for interactive use and a professional CLI for scripting and automation.
- âœ… **Comprehensive Logging:** Integrated an enterprise-grade logging system for audit trails and debugging.

## âœ… Phase 2: LLM Integration & Real-Time UI (COMPLETE)

**Objective:** Evolve the static scanner into an intelligent, interactive platform by integrating a Large Language Model for analysis and WebSockets for a real-time user experience.

#### Feature 1: "Grid-GPT" Intelligence Engine
- âœ… **LLM Client:** Integrated a client to communicate with the Groq Llama-3 API for fast, intelligent analysis.
- âœ… **Dedicated Analysis Module:** Created `lib/analysis.py` to serialize scan findings, craft high-quality analysis prompts, and process the LLM's response.
- âœ… **First-Class UI Component:** The LLM-generated analysis is now a primary feature in the UI, displayed in a dedicated, formatted section.

#### Feature 2: Real-Time, Event-Driven Frontend
- âœ… **WebSocket Integration:** Added `Flask-SocketIO` to enable bidirectional, real-time communication between the server and the browser.
- âœ… **Live Results Table:** The UI now populates the results table in real-time as findings are discovered by the scanner plugins, without requiring a page refresh.
- âœ… **Instant Completion Alerts:** The UI immediately notifies the user when a scan is complete via a WebSocket event.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Plugin & Feature Enhancement (PLANNED)

**Objective:** Enhance the core scanning engine by improving existing plugins and adding new capabilities based on the original `CamXploit.py` reference.

### Potential Priorities:
- **Early Termination:** Add logic to the credential scanner to stop testing once a valid credential is found.
- **Stream Verification:** Enhance the stream scanner to verify that discovered stream URLs are active and accessible.
- **CVE Integration:** Integrate a CVE database to provide more detailed vulnerability information.
- **Plugin Chaining:** Allow the output of one plugin to be used as the input for another (e.g., use found credentials to access and test authenticated streams).
- **Scan Performance:** Add progress reporting for long-running scans and implement timeouts to prevent hung processes.
