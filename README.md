CamXploit is a reconnaissance tool designed to help researchers and security enthusiasts check if an IP address is hosting an exposed CCTV camera. It scans common camera ports, checks for login pages, tests default credentials, and provides useful search links for further investigation.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for educational and security research purposes **only**. Unauthorized scanning of systems you do not own is illegal. Use responsibly.  

### ☁️ Run It Instantly on Google Colab (No Installation Needed)

## 🛠️ **Installation**  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spyboy-productions/CamXploit.git
```
```
cd CamXploit
```  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
```
python CamXploit.py
```
Enter the **public IP address** of the target device when prompted.  

### **🔍 What It Does:**  
1️⃣ **Scans open ports** (Common CCTV ports)  
2️⃣ **Checks if a camera is present**  
3️⃣ If a camera is found, it:  
   - Searches for **login pages**  
   - Checks **default credentials**  
   - Identifies **camera brand & vulnerabilities**  
   - Detects **live streams** (RTSP, RTMP, HTTP, MMS)  
   - Provides **location information** with maps  
   - Shows **server details** and authentication types  
4️⃣ Provides **manual search URLs** for deeper investigation  

---

## ⚡ Usage Tips
- Scanning all ports (1000+) may take several minutes, depending on your network and target.
- The tool uses multi-threading for port, login, and password checks for speed.
- If you see "No camera found" but you know a camera is present, check the open ports and look for custom ports in the output.
- For best results, run as administrator/root to avoid local firewall issues.

---

## 📚 Troubleshooting
- If no open ports are found, ensure the target is online and not behind a strict firewall.
- If live streams are not detected, try accessing the URLs manually in VLC or a browser.
- For best detection, ensure your Python version is 3.6+ and all dependencies are installed.
