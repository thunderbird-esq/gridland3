# GRIDLAND - Real Security Scanner

This project is a no-nonsense, effective network security scanner for identifying and assessing network cameras and other devices. It is designed for authorized penetration testing and security auditing.

The core philosophy of this tool is to **build things that work.** It prioritizes real functionality over marketing buzzwords and complex, unnecessary frameworks.

## Features

- **LLM-Powered Analysis:** Generates a human-readable security analysis of scan results using a Large Language Model.
- **Real-Time Web UI:** A simple, real-time web interface to run scans and view results as they are discovered, powered by WebSockets.
- **Powerful CLI:** A comprehensive command-line interface for advanced users and automation, based on the proven logic of `CamXploit.py`.
- **Multi-threaded Scanning:** High-performance, multi-threaded port scanning.
- **Device Fingerprinting:** Identifies common camera brands (Hikvision, Dahua, Axis, etc.).
- **Credential Testing:** Aggressively tests for default and common credentials on discovered devices.
- **Stream Discovery:** Scans for open RTSP and HTTP video streams.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Get a Groq API Key:** This project uses the Groq API for LLM-powered analysis. Get a free API key from [groq.com](https://groq.com/) and place it in `lib/llm_client.py`.

## Usage

There are two ways to use Gridland: the Web UI (recommended for most users) and the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

### Web UI

The web UI provides a simple way to run scans and see live results.

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
2.  **Access the UI:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Run a scan:**
    - Enter a target IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) or a network range in CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
    - Click "Start Scan".
    - Watch the results appear in real-time in the "Results" table.
    - When the scan is complete, view the "Analysis Summary" section for an AI-generated report.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `gridland_clean.py` script provides a powerful command-line interface for more advanced use cases.

**Basic Scan:**
```bash
python gridland_clean.py scan <TARGET_IP_OR_CIDR>
```

**Aggressive Scan:**
Includes credential testing and stream discovery.
```bash
python gridland_clean.py scan <TARGET_IP_OR_CIDR> --aggressive
```

**Quick Scan (Single Target):**
An alias for an aggressive scan on a single target.
```bash
python gridland_clean.py quick <TARGET_IP>
```

**Options:**
- `--threads <NUM>` or `-t <NUM>`: Set the number of concurrent scanning threads (default: 100).
- `--output <FILENAME>.json` or `-o <FILENAME>.json`: Save the results to a JSON file.

**Example:**
```bash
python gridland_clean.py scan 192.168.1.0/24 --aggressive -t 200 -o scan_results.json
```
