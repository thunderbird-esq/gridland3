# Debug Log - Secure Session Refactoring

## Issue Summary

I am currently on the verification step of the secure session refactoring task. I have implemented the new `create_secure_session` function in `lib/http.py` and refactored all scanner plugins to use it. However, I am unable to verify the changes due to persistent timeout issues in the testing environment.

## Problem Details

The verification process involves running the scanner plugins with a proxy to monitor the network traffic. I have been attempting to run the `vulnerability_scanner` plugin, but every attempt to execute the script results in a timeout after approximately 400 seconds.

## Attempts to Resolve

I have tried the following approaches to resolve the issue:

1.  **Running `server.py`:** My initial attempts to run the scanner via the main `server.py` script failed due to missing dependencies (`flask_talisman`, `flask_wtf`, `python-dotenv`) and a missing `SECRET_KEY` environment variable. I installed the dependencies and created a `.env` file to set the secret key, but the script continued to time out.

2.  **Running the plugin directly:** To isolate the issue, I created a separate script (`run_vuln_scanner.py`) to run the `VulnerabilityScannerPlugin` directly. This script also times out.

3.  **Running as a background process:** I have attempted to run both `server.py` and `run_vuln_scanner.py` as background processes, redirecting the output to log files. The processes still time out without writing to the log files.

4.  **Running python code directly:** I tried to run the python code directly from the command line, which also resulted in a timeout.

## Code Excerpts

Here is the code for the `run_vuln_scanner.py` script:

```python
import os
from plugins.vulnerability_scanner import VulnerabilityScannerPlugin

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an instance of the plugin
    plugin = VulnerabilityScannerPlugin()

    # Set the proxy URL
    proxy_url = "http://localhost:8080"
    os.environ["PROXY_URL"] = proxy_url

    # Run the scan
    plugin.scan("192.168.1.100")
```

Here is the `update_cve_database` function from `plugins/vulnerability_scanner.py` where I suspect the issue might be:

```python
def update_cve_database(self):
    """
    Downloads the latest version of the CISA KEV database.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(CVE_CACHE_FILE) or (time.time() - os.path.getmtime(CVE_CACHE_FILE)) > 86400:
        self.logger.info("Updating CVE database...")
        try:
            session = create_secure_session(use_proxy=False)
            response = session.get(CISA_KEV_URL, timeout=15)
            print(f"Response status code: {response.status_code}")
            print(f"Response content: {response.text}")
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
            session.close()

            with open(CVE_CACHE_FILE, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(data, f)
            self.logger.info("CVE database updated successfully.")
        except (requests.exceptions.RequestException, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Failed to update CVE database: {e}")
            # If the database update fails, try to load the old cache if it exists
            if os.path.exists(CVE_CACHE_FILE):
                self.logger.info("Using cached CVE database.")
            else:
                return False
    return True
```

## Assistance Needed

I am currently blocked and unable to proceed with the verification. I need assistance with the following:

*   **Diagnosing the timeout issue:** I need help understanding why the execution environment is timing out. Is there a resource limit I am hitting? Is there a problem with the network configuration in the sandbox?
*   **Alternative verification methods:** If the current verification method is not feasible, I need guidance on an alternative way to verify the secure session implementation.

Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.
